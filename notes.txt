trafficGraph = graph of current roads(edges) and intersections(vertices/nodes)
roadOrder = list of RoadData objects.
RoadData = object with road(edge), greenOn, greenOff and cycle reset for roads
           in the order they appeared.
carCommandList = list of lists. Each inner list has the road(from int, to int),
                                cycle to add the cars on and the carDestinations list.
carDestinations = list of destinations for the cars queued to go on the road
printCommandCycleNumber = list of what cycles to print a command on
